            Operating systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage. The General Motors Research Lab implemented the first OS in the early 1950s for their IBM 701. In the mid-1960s, operating systems started to use disks. In the late 1960s, the first version of the Unix OS was developed. The first OS built by Microsoft was DOS.
