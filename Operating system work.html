        <div>
            An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the deviceâ€™s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.
